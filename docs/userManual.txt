### Operation 1: List all items
* By default, the program will list all items on the server. To return to this view, the user can at any time hit the "All" filter button at the top.

### Operation 2: Add a new item
* To add an item, simply hit the "Add Item" button at the bottom of the main window. A dialog will open.
* Upon selecting a "Type" from the list at the top, the text fields will reveal themselves for entry.
* The dialog makes it crystal clear when the input is valid or not: the label next to the text field turns green or red. Green for valid, red for invalid.
* If the user is unsure of what constitutes "valid" or "invalid", hovering the mouse over the text field will let them know.

### Operation 3: Remove an item
* In the list view, each item has a garbage can icon next to the item's information.
* Clicking this icon will ask for confirmation of deletion (with help from a guest celebrity)
* If the user selects "yes", the item will be removed from the list and the server list will automatically update.

### Operation 4: List expired items
* Pressing the "Expired" button at the top will immediately filter the list to display only items that are expired.

### Operation 5: List unexpired items
* Pressing the "Not Expired" button at the top will immediately filter the list to display only items that aren't expired.

### Operation 6: List items expiring in 7 days
* Pressing the "Expiring in 7 Days" button at the top will immediately filter the list to display only items that are expiring within the next week.

### Operation 7: Exit
* The exit button will cause the client to attempt to save the server's items list, and then the program will exit.
