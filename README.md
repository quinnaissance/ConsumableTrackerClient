# Consumable Tracker (Client)

![]/(img/demo.gif)

This client program uses the MVC pattern with Java OOP and Swing, AWT, Gson, and HttpURLConnection to implement a GUI allowing the user to keep track of a custom Consumable object type.

The client communicates with ConsumableTrackerServer to send and receive serialized Consumable objects.
